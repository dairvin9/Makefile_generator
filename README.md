Makefile_generator
==================

This program generates makefiles.

Basically it queries the user for all the variables used in the makefile and then writes it out.

It takes optional commandline arguments, that become the name of the Executable file generated. If no 
arguments are given, the name of the file is "Makefile."

Right now, it only supports one target, but I plan to expand that deficiency.
